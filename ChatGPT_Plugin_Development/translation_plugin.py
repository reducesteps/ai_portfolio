# translation_plugin.py

# This is an example script for a ChatGPT plugin that translates text between languages.
# It could use an API like Google Translate to translate text based on user input.

def translate_text(text, target_language):
    # Here, you would typically make an API call to a translation service.
    # For this example, let's return a mock response.
    return f'Translation of "{text}" to {target_language}: (Translated Text Here)'
