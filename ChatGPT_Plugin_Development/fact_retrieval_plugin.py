# fact_retrieval_plugin.py

# This is an example script for a ChatGPT plugin that retrieves facts based on user queries.
# It could use an API like Wolfram Alpha to get facts based on user input.

def get_fact(query):
    # Here, you would typically make an API call to a fact retrieval service.
    # For this example, let's return a mock response.
    return f'Fact about {query}: (Fact Details Here)'
