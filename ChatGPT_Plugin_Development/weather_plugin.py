# weather_plugin.py

# This is an example script for a ChatGPT plugin that fetches real-time weather data.
# It could use an API like OpenWeatherMap to get the current weather for a given location.

def get_weather(location):
    # Here, you would typically make an API call to a weather service.
    # For this example, let's return a mock response.
    return f'The current weather in {location} is sunny with a temperature of 25Â°C.'
